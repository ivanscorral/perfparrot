# PerfParrot

*Note*: THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT IS NOT YET READY FOR USE. SEE [TODO](TODO.md) FOR MORE INFORMATION.

`PerfParrot` is a Rust-based profiler and analyzer for executables and commands. It aims to provide accurate statistics about a program's performance, making it easier to identify bottlenecks and optimize code.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Profile any command or executable, with or without additional arguments.
- **Metrics Collection**: Gather essential metrics like CPU usage, execution time, and memory consumption.
- **Multiple Runs**: Execute the command multiple times for more consistent statistical data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Derive key statistics from your data, such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Visualization (Planned)**: View your data in a digestible format with charts and tables.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: (Your installation steps will go here, e.g., `cargo install perfparrot` or instructions to clone and build from source.)
2. **Usage**: Basic command to run the tool, for example:

```bash
perfparrot --cmd "node app.js" --runs 100
```

## Configuration

(Any configuration options or files the user should know about.)
