# **PerfParrot: Detailed To-Do List**

## **Objective**

Build a robust and reliable profiler and analyzer for executables and commands using Rust, offering insights into performance metrics and statistical analysis.

## **Considerations**

- **Safety**: Ensure the tool doesn't cause unintended side effects on the profiled commands.
- **Portability**: Aim for cross-platform support, especially across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Overhead**: The profiling process should introduce minimal overhead to avoid skewing results.
- **User Experience**: Ensure easy setup and intuitive command-line usage.

## **Core Features**

1. **Command Execution**:
    - [ ] Parse user input for command or executable and arguments.
    - [ ] Handle and report execution errors gracefully.
    - [ ] Support a configuration file for repeated and complex profiling setups.

2. **Metrics Collection**:
    - [ ] Implement CPU usage tracking.
    - [ ] Measure execution time with high precision.
    - [ ] Track memory consumption throughout the command's execution.
    - [ ] (Optional) Monitor I/O operations, network usage, etc.

3. **Multiple Runs**:
    - [ ] Allow sequential or parallel multiple runs.
    - [ ] Store results for each run separately for statistical analysis.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
    - [ ] Compute basic statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
    - [ ] Identify outliers in the data.
    - [ ] Offer percentile data (e.g., 95th percentile execution time).

5. **Visualization**:
    - [ ] Print tabular data for metrics after profiling.
    - [ ] (Future) Implement graph generation for visualizing metrics.

## **Implementation Considerations in Rust**

1. **Concurrency**:
    - [ ] Use Rust's async features for concurrent runs.
    - [ ] Ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - [ ] Make extensive use of Rust's `Result` type for error handling.
    - [ ] Provide clear error messages for common issues.

3. **Data Storage**:
    - [ ] Decide on in-memory vs. disk storage for metrics data.
    - [ ] If using disk storage, ensure efficient write operations using buffers.

4. **Dependency Management**:
    - [ ] Limit the number of external crates to reduce compilation time and potential security risks.
    - [ ] Regularly check and update dependencies for security patches.

5. **Performance**:
    - [ ] Profile `PerfParrot` itself to ensure minimal overhead.
    - [ ] Optimize hot paths in the code, especially in the metrics collection phase.

6. **Testing**:
    - [ ] Write unit tests for core functionalities.
    - [ ] Consider property-based testing for more complex features.
    - [ ] Run integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality.

7. **Documentation**:
    - [ ] Document public APIs with Rust doc comments.
    - [ ] Create user documentation for setting up and using `PerfParrot`.

## **Future Steps**:
- [ ] Allow for extensibility with plugins or hooks.
- [ ] Integrate with popular CI/CD systems for automated performance tracking.
- [ ] Implement a GUI for a more interactive experience.
